Data Mining,13-06-2022,IBM,https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/data-mining,"Data mining, also known as knowledge discovery in data (KDD), is the process of uncovering patterns and other valuable information from large data sets."
Data Mining,13-06-2022,Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining,"Data mining is the process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems.[1] Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal to extract information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transform the information into a comprehensible structure for further use.[1][2][3][4] Data mining is the analysis step of the ""knowledge discovery in databases"" process or KDD.[5] Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.[1]"
Data Mining,13-06-2022,SAS,https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/data-mining.html,"Data mining is the process of finding anomalies, patterns and correlations within large data sets to predict outcomes. Using a broad range of techniques, you can use this information to increase revenues, cut costs, improve customer relationships, reduce risks and more."
Data Mining,13-06-2022,Investopedia,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/datamining.asp,"Data mining is a process used by companies to turn raw data into useful information. By using software to look for patterns in large batches of data, businesses can learn more about their customers to develop more effective marketing strategies, increase sales and decrease costs. Data mining depends on effective data collection, warehousing, and computer processing."
Data Mining,13-06-2022,Talend,https://www.talend.com/resources/what-is-data-mining/,"Data mining is the process of analyzing massive volumes of data to discover business intelligence that can help companies solve problems, mitigate risks, and seize new opportunities. "
Data Mining,13-06-2022,TechTarget,https://searchsqlserver.techtarget.com/definition/data-mining,Data mining is the process of sorting through large data sets to identify patterns and establish relationships to solve problems through data analysis. Data mining tools allow enterprises to predict future trends.
Data Mining,13-06-2022,Guru99,https://www.guru99.com/data-mining-tutorial.html,"Data Mining is a process of finding potentially useful patterns from huge data sets. It is a multi-disciplinary skill that uses machine learning, statistics, and AI to extract information to evaluate future events probability."
Data Mining,13-06-2022,Datamation,https://www.datamation.com/big-data/what-is-data-mining.html,"Data mining is the means by which organizations extract value from their data, and it has become increasingly central to maintaining a competitive edge in business."
Data Mining,13-06-2022,Iberdrola,https://www.iberdrola.com/innovation/data-mining-definition-examples-and-applications,"Data mining is an automatic or semi-automatic technical process that analyses large amounts of scattered information to make sense of it and turn it into knowledge. It looks for anomalies, patterns or correlations among millions of records to predict results, as indicated by the SAS Institute, a world leader in business analytics."
Data Mining,13-06-2022,Simplilearn,https://www.simplilearn.com/data-mining-vs-machine-learning-article,"Data mining is considered the process of extracting useful information from a vast amount of data. It’s used to discover new, accurate, and useful patterns in the data, looking for meaning and relevant information for the organization or individual who needs it. It’s a tool used by humans."
Data Mining,13-06-2022,Intellipaat,https://intellipaat.com/community/41134/what-is-data-mining-and-how-is-machine-learning-related-to-it,Data mining is the process of extracting usable and required information from a large set of data.
Data Mining,13-06-2022,Science Daily,https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/data_mining.htm,"Data mining, also known as knowledge-discovery in databases (KDD), is the practice of automatically searching large stores of data for patterns."
Data Mining,13-06-2022,Oracle ,https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/DMCON/GUID-8232ABAD-E6B9-4C70-B227-E00738040932.htm#DMCON111,Data mining is the practice of automatically searching large stores of data to discover patterns and trends that go beyond simple analysis. Data mining uses sophisticated mathematical algorithms to segment the data and to predict the likelihood of future events based on past events. Data mining is also known as Knowledge Discovery in Data (KDD).
Data Mining,13-06-2022,Forbes,https://www.forbes.com/sites/metabrown/2018/07/31/basics-of-data-mining-that-business-people-should-know/?sh=1b7cc1d6515f," Data mining is a specific way to use specific kinds of math. It's characterized by: Available data, rather than data collected specifically for research"
