Machine Learning ,13-06-2022,Towards Data Science,https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-learn-machine-learning-data-science-in-2020-5233e766e0af,the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed [1]
Machine Learning ,13-06-2022,IBM,https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/machine-learning,"Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy."
Machine Learning ,13-06-2022,EXPERT.AI,https://www.expert.ai/blog/machine-learning-definition/,Machine learning is an application of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.
Machine Learning ,13-06-2022,SAS,https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/machine-learning.html,"Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention."
Machine Learning ,13-06-2022,Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning,"Machine learning (ML) is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that 'learn', that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks.[1] It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence."
Machine Learning ,13-06-2022,MIT,https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-explained,"Machine learning is behind chatbots and predictive text, language translation apps, the shows Netflix suggests to you, and how your social media feeds are presented. It powers autonomous vehicles and machines that can diagnose medical conditions based on images. "
Machine Learning ,13-06-2022,Coursera,https://www.coursera.org/lecture/machine-learning/what-is-machine-learning-Ujm7v,"Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. "
Machine Learning ,13-06-2022,Microsoft,https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-machine-learning-platform/,"Machine learning (ML) is the process of using mathematical models of data to help a computer learn without direct instruction. It’s considered a subset of artificial intelligence (AI). Machine learning uses algorithms to identify patterns within data, and those patterns are then used to create a data model that can make predictions."
Machine Learning ,13-06-2022,Geekforgeeks,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/,"Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across. As it is evident from the name, it gives the computer that makes it more similar to humans"
Machine Learning ,13-06-2022,MatLab,https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/machine-learning.html,Machine learning is a data analytics technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans and animals: learn from experience. Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to “learn” information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model.
Machine Learning ,13-06-2022,Oracle,https://www.oracle.com/data-science/machine-learning/what-is-machine-learning/,Machine learning (ML) is the subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that learn—or improve performance—based on the data they consume
Machine Learning ,13-06-2022,Royal Society,https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/machine-learning/videos-and-background-information/,"Machine learning is used in internet search engines, email filters to sort out spam, websites to make personalised recommendations, banking software to detect unusual transactions, and lots of apps on our phones such as voice recognition."
Machine Learning ,13-06-2022,Investopedia,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/machine-learning.asp,Machine learning is the concept that a computer program can learn and adapt to new data without human intervention. 
Machine Learning ,13-06-2022,MIT Tech Review,https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/11/17/103781/what-is-machine-learning-we-drew-you-another-flowchart/,"Machine learning is the process that powers many of the services we use today—recommendation systems like those on Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify; search engines like Google and Baidu; social-media feeds like Facebook and Twitter; voice assistants like Siri and Alexa. "
